### Power calculation

For a linear regression model with 20 coefficients and 3,000 observations we have 80% power to detect a very small effect size of .005 and 95% power to detect a very small effect size of .01.[@cohen2013; @champely2020]

### Data analysis plan

#### Exploratory data analysis

[do we need text about making the scale scores?]

Given the novel nature of our project, we will conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, with a particularly thorough exploratory focus on religious subgroups that are likely to be smaller in sample size (e.g., Jewish religion, Islamic religion). EDA will include appropriate descriptive statistics for all variables of interest and additional bivariate descriptive statistics and visualization examining the distribution of outcome scale scores by religious affiliation and religiosity.

#### Mediation and moderation analyses

We will use a hierarchical linear modeling strategy. For each outcome variable, we will start with a simple linear model including only religiosity. For Model 2 (a & b), we will add control demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that have some relationship to the outcome (i.e., religious affiliation, sex, education, income) and examine the change in the relationship of interest and in model fit. Model 3 (a & b) will test whether trust in medicine mediates the relationship between religiosity and each outcome. Model 4 (a & b) will determine whether knowledge of genetics, age, and rurality moderate the relationship between religiosity and concern and support for genomics and genomic healthcare. If mediation is confirmed in Model 3, Model 4 will be a moderated mediation model. If mediation is not confirmed, trust in medicine will remain in the model as a control variable while moderation is tested.
